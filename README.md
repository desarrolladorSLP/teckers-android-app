# Teckers Android App

## About us and the project
### What is teckers?

Teckers is a school dedicated to girls and boys between nine and nineteen years old, to help them develop and strengthen the skills and knowledge necessary to create technological solutions to social problems in their community.

### What do we want do?

In this project we do not give the task of creating a functional mobile application for the android system.
The android app of "teckes" plans to facilitate the handling and communication between students and teckers in a faster and more precise way.

## Technology

It will work giving different types of tools, such as messaging and attendance control management in students.
We work with the version 1.0 (the first version) of the app, currently under development.

### Development

We work with different development technologies that you must acquire for the correct operation of the application, which are the following:
<br>

| Technology        | Version           | Type  |
| ----------------- |:-----------------:| -----:|
| Android Studio    |        3.2.2      |  IDE  |
| Kotlin            |  1.3.30           |   Plugging to an programming language |

#### Android Studio
Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating systems. It is a replacement for the Eclipse Android Development Tools (ADT) as the primary IDE for native Android application development.

<br>
If you do not have the Android Studio IDE installed you can follow these steps:

##### Windows

2. If you download `.exe` file(recommended), double click on it to start it.
3. If you downloaded a `.zip` file, extract it and copy the android-studio folder to your Program Files folder. Next, open the android-studio> bin folder and then start `studio64.exe`(for 64-bit machines) or `studio.exe` (for 32-bit machines).
4. Follow the steps in the setup wizard in Android Studio and make sure you install the recommended SDK packages.

#### Kotlin
Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript or native code (via LLVM). Kotlin is sponsored by JetBrains and Google through the Kotlin Foundation.
<br>
<br>
From the android studio application you can download kotlin like this:
1. Open the Settings window through the File Menu> Settings.
2. Enter the Plugins option.
3. Click on Browse repositories ...
4. Find the Kotlin plugin and click on the Install button.
